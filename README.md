### API SETUP
clone this repo into your local machine https://github.com/typicode/json-server

## copy the json file under this path /src/utils/api.json(you will find it in the react application/RECRUITMENT-APP) into db.json on the api repository which you cloned path /json-server/db.json (JSON_SERVER)

## npm/yarn start 
to spin up a local server and make sure you leave it running when launching the react application this is because the react app dependence on the server=localhost://3000 in making api requests

### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
I had to pick the technologies that are easy to work with to make sure that I deliver the assessment solution within stipulated time

 


### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
improve on the design and ensure the api calls are called efficiently. I will also refactor my code and ensure there is seperation of concern within the folder structure and functions
